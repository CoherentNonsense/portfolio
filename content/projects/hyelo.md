## About
I had a phase where I tried making way too many social networks. Somewhere during that period, I wanted to make something very minimal with a couple features that I could implement quickly without the weight of a full social network. I thought an Omegle clone with the addition of private/public chat rooms was a cool idea and so I set myself a weekend to create it.

## Tech Stack
At the time, I was waist deep in React, though I felt it was a little too much for such a small app (I may have been getting sick of it as well), so I chose to just keep it simple with pure javascript in the front end, and socket.io with express in the back.
