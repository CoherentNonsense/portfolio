## About

Trist is an anonymous social network I used to recreate everytime I learn something new. In this final iteration of Trist, I had discovered the domain driven design architecture, and I went full DDD.

## How'd It Go?

Domain driven design is a pretty nifty idea, but for a small single person project it was a lot of overkill. Creating a feature as simple as logging in had to go through multiple layers of the 'onion architecture' just to return a token. Even still, I enjoyed the process of it and it did make more complex operations a little more comprehensible, but for my future projects, I will most likely stick to something more simple.
