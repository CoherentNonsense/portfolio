      <description>About Trist is an anonymous social network I used to recreate everytime I learn something new. In this final iteration of Trist, I had discovered the domain driven design architecture, and I went full DDD.
How&amp;rsquo;d It Go? Domain driven design is a pretty nifty idea, but for a small single person project it was a lot of overkill. Creating a feature as simple as logging in had to go through multiple layers of the &amp;lsquo;onion architecture&amp;rsquo; just to return a token.</description>

      <description>About I had a phase where I tried making way too many social networks. Somewhere during that period, I wanted to make something very minimal with a couple features that I could implement quickly without the weight of a full social network. I thought an Omegle clone with the addition of private/public chat rooms was a cool idea and so I set myself a weekend to create it.
Tech Stack At the time, I was waist deep in React, though I felt it was a little too much for such a small app (I may have been getting sick of it as well), so I chose to just keep it simple with pure javascript in the front end, and socket.</description>

      <description>About Inspired by the solitaire game designed by Tom Francis. This is pretty much a filler project until I get more projects. T&amp;rsquo;was a school project that I enjoyed making.</description>
