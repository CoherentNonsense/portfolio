      <description>Preface These series of posts will assume basic programming knowledge. You can find a series I made on that here. (Not made yet)
I want most of the examples to be language agnostic, but since I will be showing a full implementation, some parts will be specific to Javascript, which is what Hypnosis is written in.
Hypnosis will be a game engine specifically built for games and simulations to be run on my blog.</description>

      <title>Hypnosis: A Small Game Engine for My Blog</title>

      <description>A Game Engine for a Blog? So to make my blog the special unicorn that it is, I want my content to have a fun and interactive side to it with tiny games and simulations that compliment my writing. These programs will be run using Javascript (The programming language used in browsers).
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to program everything from scratch everytime I want to make a small simulation. This is why I will be making a game engine which can do a bunch of things that all my programs will probably need like rendering sprites and getting user input.</description>
